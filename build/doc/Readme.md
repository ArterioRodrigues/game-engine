g++ -g -o run src/main.cpp src/glad.c -I./include -L./lib -lglfw3 -ldl -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit

g++:
This invokes the GNU C++ compiler, used to compile C++ source files.
-g:
Enables debugging information to be included in the output. This allows you to use a debugger (like gdb or lldb) to inspect the program during execution.
-o run:
Specifies the output file's name as run. The compiled binary executable will be named run. Without this option, the compiler would default to creating a file named a.out.
src/main.cpp and src/glad.c:
These are the source files to be compiled. main.cpp contains your program's entry point, and glad.c contains the OpenGL function loader generated by GLAD.
-I./include:
Adds the ./include directory to the compiler's list of directories to search for header files. This ensures that #include <glad/glad.h> and #include <GLFW/glfw3.h> can find their respective files in ./include.
-L./lib:
Adds the ./lib directory to the linker’s list of directories to search for libraries. This is where the linker will look for libglfw3.a.
-lglfw3:
Links the program against the static library libglfw3.a. The -l flag tells the linker to look for a file named lib<name>.a or lib<name>.so.
-ldl:
Links the program against the dl library. This is commonly used for dynamic linking and is required for GLFW on Linux and macOS.
-framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit (macOS only):
These flags link the program to macOS-specific frameworks:
Cocoa: For creating and managing windows and events.
OpenGL: Provides the OpenGL rendering context.
IOKit: Provides low-level system access for handling input devices.
What Are the Output Files?
run:
This is the final compiled executable program. You can run it from the terminal by typing:
./run
run.dSYM (macOS only):
This is a directory containing debug symbols for the program, created because of the -g flag. Debug symbols map the compiled code back to the original source code, which is useful for debugging. When you debug the program using tools like lldb, the run.dSYM directory helps you see which lines of code correspond to the machine instructions being executed.
If you don’t need debugging information (e.g., for a release build), you can omit the -g flag, and the run.dSYM directory won’t be created.
Summary
The g++ command compiles and links your source files into an executable named run.
The run file is the executable program.
The run.dSYM directory contains debug information and is only needed for debugging.
